					<h3>What I do for Work</h3>
					<p>I'm a self-employed and work-from-home online physics and math tutor. This is a career path that branched off of my two years as a high school physics teacher at <a href="https://wellesleyps.org/whs/" target="_blank">Wellesley High School</a> in 2014‚Äî2016.</p>
					<p>Most of my teaching time is focused on Sundays 9:00am‚Äì4:00pm and Mondays‚ÄìThursdays 3:00pm-10:00pm, late August through early June. It's unfortunately not the best work schedule from the perspective of being able to socalize, but I'm passionate about this job enough that it is worth it for me.</p>
					<p>You can learn more about this on my main website at <a href="http://www.trevorkafka.com">www.trevorkafka.com</a>.</p>
					<details>
						<summary>How did I become a tutor?</summary>
						<p>I tutored part time consistently from 2015 through 2020 while progressively transitioning from mostly physics students to mostly math students and was tutoring students either in their own homes or in public spaces (libraries, coffee shops, etc). It was a LOT of driving! </p>
						<p>Once the pandemic hit in 2020, I pivoted to full time tutoring and also took the business online, which is what I continue to do today. </p>

					<h3>Love of Learning</h3>
					<p><strong>Physics & Math</strong> - I have been and always will be a huge physics and math nerd. I lean towards a strong understanding of the fundamentals over trying to get as advanced as possible. Always open to chatting if you're a fellow nerd too!</p> $$e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$$
					<p>
						<strong>Foreign Languages</strong> - Some languages I have enjoyed studying over the years include 
						<span class="lang">Espa√±ol (Spanish)</span>,
						<span class="lang">Fran√ßais (French)</span>, 
						<span class="lang">Ê±âËØ≠ (Mandarin)</span>,
						<span class="lang">Êó•Êú¨Ë™û (Japanese)</span>, 
						<span class="lang">Á≤µË™û (Cantonese)</span>,
						<span class="lang">Nederlands (Dutch)</span>, and
						<span class="lang">‡∏†‡∏≤‡∏©‡∏≤‡πÑ‡∏ó‡∏¢ (Thai)</span> along with occasional dabbling in 
						<span class="lang">Ti·∫øng Vi·ªát (Vietnamese)</span> and 
						<span class="lang">Deutsch (German)</span>. 
						None are perfect; some are far from perfect!

			<h1>‚ú® Current Interests</h1>
			<p>Here is how I have been spending my free time lately. All of our habits change frequently, so stuff in this section will change frequently too!</p>
				<div class="grid">
					<div class="container">
						<h3>Practicing Yoga</h3>
						<p>Yoga is something I've been practicing on-and-off for a very, very long time‚Äîsince roughly 2008. Sometimes I get into a good groove with it and sometimes it just needs to take a bit of a pause for a while (especially when travelling).</p>
						<img src="media/TK yoga.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 20px auto; width: 250px; border-radius: 10px">
						<p>At the moment, at least, I have been in a nice yoga kick, and it has been fun to try to rebuild my skills after a long set of months off. Mobility is always a slow process to reinstate, but it will come back with patience and determination.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="container">
						<h3>Aerial Circus Arts</h3>
						<p>Aerial circus arts is something I've practiced for years‚Äîfrom 2006 to 2020, in fact. I had a fairly extensive career teaching, instructing, and even performing aerial circus arts in the Boston area, which culminated in me opening up my own studio in Waltham, Massachusetts in 2017‚Äì2020.</p>
						<img src="media/TK aerial.jpg" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto 20px auto; width: 250px; border-radius: 10px">
						<p>Unfortunately, as with many things, the pandemic forced me to close my studio and for the many years to follow I allowed my life to take a different path away from circus arts. I've been reviving recreational practice of circus arts since 2024. While I do not know exactly where it will lead me, it is likely that it will remain a recreational practice at least in the immediate future.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="container">
						<h3>Learning Vietnamese</h3>
						<p>I'm an avid language learner‚Äîsometimes more than others‚Äîbut I have been learning languages enough to recieve recognition at <a href="https://www.polyglotassociation.org/members/trevor-kafka" target="_blank">HYPIA</a>, The International Association of Hyperpolyglots. Travel is a big motivator to dictate which languages I want to learn and lately I have been looking forward towards a trip to Vietnam in Summer 2025, which has given me motivation to learn Vietnamese.</p>
						<p><em>R·∫•t vui ƒë∆∞·ª£c l√†m quen v·ªõi b·∫°n! T√¥i c√≥ th·ªÉ n√≥i m·ªôt √≠t Ti·∫øng Vi·ªát.</em> I've been getting my foundations through lessons with <a href="http://www.pimsleur.com/" target="_blank">Pimsleur</a> and soon plan to switch to lessons on <a href="http://www.italki.com/" target="_blank">italki</a> with a live teacher. While taking audio lessons with Pimsleur, I've been enjoying taking neighborhood walks concurrently.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="container">
						<h3>Website Building, JavaScript, and Python</h3>
						<p>I'm VERY amateur at this sort of stuff, but I have been having quite a fun time building webpages for myself from scratch (such as this one and the rest of my <a href="http://www.trevorkafka.com." target="_blank">website</a>) using HTML, CSS, and a teeney tiny bit of JavaScript. </p>
						<p>I am occasionally working to learn more about JavaScript and Python through <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>. I hope to be able to create more interactive webpages using JavaScript in the future as well as be able to create mathematics animations with <a href="https://www.manim.community/" target="_blank">Manim</a>, an open-source Python library.</p>

			<h1>‚úàÔ∏è Travel Plans</h1>
			<p>Travelling at the same time and in the same place as me? Shoot me a message and maybe let's meet up!</p>
				<div class="grid">
					<div class="container">
						<h3>Upstate New York</h3>
						<h4>November 23 ‚Äì December 7, 2024<br>Hampton & Glens Falls, NY</h4>
						<p>
							Thanksgiving has always been a time for family for me and this year will be no exception. I will be spending two weeks visiting family in upstate New York near the Vermont border.
					</div>
					<div class="container">
						<h3>Spain - Canary Islands</h3>
						<h4>January 3 ‚Äì February 4, 2025<br>Las Palmas de Grand Canaria</h4>
						<h4>February 4 ‚Äì 14, 2025<br>Santa Cruz de Tenerife</h4>
						<p>I'm excited to be spending four weeks escaping winter and practicing Spanish at one of my favorite winter destinations, Las Palmas de Grand Canaria, for the third time. I will also be taking a week and a half to explore a new-to-me city: Santa Cruz de Tenerife. Both of these destinations are great for remote working, beaches and swimming, as well as nature exploring.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="container">
						<h3>Italy - Venice & Rome</h3>
						<h4>February 14 ‚Äì 17, 2025<br>Venice</h4>
						<h4>February 17 ‚Äì 21, 2025<br>Rome</h4>
						<p>During the week of President's Day when a fair number of Boston-area schools take a break from classes (and thus my workload for tutoring naturally diminishes for a week), I will be exploring Venice and Rome for a couple days each.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="container">
						<h3>Taiwan - Taipei</h3>
						<h4>February 22 ‚Äì March 15, 2025</h4>
						<p>For three weeks in February and March, I will be spending time in Taipei exploring the city, enjoying the delicious food at night markets, and practicing my Mandarin with the locals.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="container">
						<h3>Indonesia - Wakatobi</h3>
						<h4>May 30 ‚Äì June 9, 2025</h4>
						<p>My parents and I all are SCUBA divers. I have been SCUBA certified since I was 11 years old and lately will go on SCUBA trips roughly once every two years. We will be taking part in a group liveaboard SCUBA trip along with some other fellow SCUBA divers for a little over a week in Wakatobi, Indonesia to get a chance to experience firsthand what the ocean has to offer on the amazing <a href="https://divegaia.com/" target="_blank">Gaia Love</a> dive boat. <strong>I will have no internet access during this trip.</strong></p>
					</div>
					<div class="container">
						<h3>(TBD) Thailand & Vietnam</h3>
						<p>My plans after SCUBA diving in Wakatobi are still to be determined, but likely will involve some combination of both destinations in Thailand as well as destinations in Vietnam (which is why I am currently working to learn some Vietnamese). I have been to Thailand twice so far, but this would be my first visit to Vietnam.</p>
					</div>
