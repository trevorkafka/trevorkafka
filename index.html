				Hello! My name is Trevor Kafka, and I am an online teacher of physics and mathematics. I am highly enthusiastic about all topics that I teach and have extensive experience teaching all levels, all the way from middle school math through college-level math and physics, and beyond. I also teach AP, SAT, ACT, and other school admissions exams, including the notoriously difficult AP Physics C exam. I am a graduate of Brandeis University holding a double major in physics and mathematics and worked as a lead instructor at Wellesley High School for two years. Since 2014, I have been teaching group and 1-on-1 physics and math classes extensively.
			</p>

			<p>
				Whether you are looking for help in your current class, looking to prepare for an upcoming exam, or want to improve your skills out of personal interest, I am confident that I will be able to provide you with lessons that are engaging, effective, and invaluable. I look forward to working with you soon!

							Trevor Kafka has helped build confidence in my son's math skills. Trevor is very patient and supportive. He is able to explain difficult concepts easily and concisely. I had concerns of tutoring over Zoom being cold and impersonal and was pleasantly surprised. Trevor was able to understand my son's needs and engage and encourage him. I highly recommend Trevor.

							Before beginning work with Trevor, my son was struggling to grasp the key content knowledge from his high school physics class and his grades were lower than we had liked. Trevor took a wide variety of difficult concepts and made them easy for my son to understand, which had positive effects on his coursework and overall understanding this year. My son enjoyed the sessions and found him approachable. As a parent, I found Trevor very responsive and highly organized: two characteristics I appreciate as a working mother of teenagers.

							Our 8yo son started working with Trevor in September 2020 for Chinese and Math tutoring.  Trevor is extremely well organized and his positive and motivating communication style has helped our son make amazing progress in both subjects.  In just a couple short months he mastered over 50 Chinese characters and could carry on a brief conversation.  In math, he works above grade level and has built his confidence and logical thinking as a result of these lessons. Trevor's use of technology in the virtual classes is brilliant, greatly enhancing the learning.  The homework assignments are interesting and stimulating for our son.  We highly recommend Trevor for Chinese and math tutoring and we are considering hiring him for physics tutoring when our son is ready.  We feel really fortunate to have found Trevor, our son has benefited a great deal from these classes!

			<div>
				<p>Yes, I most certainly can and am happy to! Homework assignments are available <strong>by request</strong>. They are generally not provided by default but under most circumstances are offered free of charge.</p>
	
				<p>Students are often very busy, so additional tutor-assigned homework is not always appropriate, but if it would be helpful to have homework assignments from me given to you for time outside of class, please let me know, and I can provide this to you for no extra charge (as long as the amount of time it takes me to construct and review the assignments is within reason).</p>
	
				<p>For regular students who elect to have assignments, I often set up Google Classroom pages to organize class materials, including notes and homework assignments.</p>

				</ul>
	
				<p>Exceptions to this policy may be made on a case-by-case basis, usually under circumstances where late schedule changes do not pose an inconvenience. The fundamental intent of these policies is so that I can ensure a reliable work schedule and work-life balance, not to create "gotcha" situations for clients. I try to be as reasonable as possible in consideration of the factors surrounding any late cancellation and I request the same of my clients.</p>
