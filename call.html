		<h1>Reserve Your Free Introductory Call</h1>

		<div style="border: solid 1px black; border-radius: 5px; line-height: 24px; padding: 10px; margin: 20px; background-color: #FFFFFF80; text-align: center">
			New students begin by scheduling a free non-binding 20-minute introductory call with me before scheduling tutoring sessions. Scheduling the introductory call also sets you up on my online registration system, which manages tutoring session booking and billing.
		</div>

		<p>Your first step is to book a free <strong>20-minute introductory call</strong> with me where we will discuss your current learning goals, coursework to date (if applicable), the classes that I teach, how I can best help you, teaching methods, scheduling, billing, and anything else you'd like to discuss.</p>

		<p>These sessions are <strong>free of charge</strong> and are <em>non-binding</em>. Please note that this 20-minute intro call is <em>not</em> a tutoring session, so no formal instruction will be provided. Whether or not you choose to puruse tutoring after our intro call is 100% up to you. This time is intended to be a way to
			<ul>
				<li>set goals, 
				<li>share background information, 
				<li>get the chance to ask/answer any quetsions we may have, and
				<li>learn how we can form the perfect team. 
			</ul>
		I'm looking forward to meeting you and helping <strong>YOU</strong> make a breakthrough in your own success!</p>

		<p>Please feel free to email me at <trevorkafka-email></trevorkafka-email> if you would like to chat via email beforehand for any reason. If you are in urgent need of tutoring and would like to skip the intro call process, please email me for a direct link to my registration form.</p>

		<div class="FAQ" style="margin-bottom: 16px">
			<details>
				<summary>Why do I need to enter billing details in order to submit this form?</summary>
				<p style="padding-top: 20px">As of September 2021, inputting billing details is required to register for an account and schedule tutoring sessions with me. Having credit card information already filled out makes it easier in the future for families to settle payments for any meetings for tutoring that are scheduled <em>beyond</em> the free intro call. This ultimately helps avoid situations where I have to track down clients for payment information in the case a bill ends up being overdue for an extended period of time.</p>
				<ul>
						<li> Sign-up and introductory calls are <strong>free and non-binding</strong>.
						<li> Payment will <strong>NOT</strong> be due unless you register for tutoring sessions. There is never any requirement or pressure ot sign up for tutoring sessions after completing the free intro call.
						<li> Payments will <strong>NOT</strong> be automatically charged to your card unless you enroll in automatic payments in your profile settings after submitting your registration form. 
						<li> <em>You are in control of when payments are made. </em>
				</ul>
