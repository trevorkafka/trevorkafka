		<h1>Reserve Your Free Introductory Call</h1>

		<p>Your first step is to book a free <strong>20-minute introductory call</strong> with me where we will discuss your current learning goals, coursework to date (if applicable), the classes that I teach, how I can best help you, teaching methods, scheduling, billing, and anything else you'd like to discuss.</p>

		<p>These sessions are <strong>free of charge</strong>. Please note that this is not a tutoring session, so no formal instruction will be provided. This time is intended to be a way to set goals, share background information, and for both of us to learn how we can best form the perfect team. I'm looking forward to meeting you and helping YOU make a breakthrough in your own success!</p> 

		<p>Please make sure the correct time zone is selected when picking a time from the calendar. It should be automatically determined based on your computer's time zome.</p>

				<summary>Why do I need to enter billing details in order to submit this form?</summary>
				<p>Please note that inputting billing details is required in order to submit a registration form, but no fees are charged to you unless you decide to continue with formal tutoring sessions. Here are some more details.</p>
				<ul>
						<li> Sign-up and introductory calls are <strong>free and non-binding</strong> and you will NOT be billed unless you take future tutoring sesions.
						<li> Having credit card information already filled out makes it easier in the future for families to make payments once payments are due after tutoring sessions have been taken (this ultimately helps avoid situations where I have to track down clients for payment information in the case a bill ends up being overdue for an extended period of time).
						<li> Payments will <strong>NOT</strong> be automatically charged to your card unless you enroll in automatic payments in your profile settings after submitting your registration form. 
						<li> <em>You are in control of when payments are made.</em>
