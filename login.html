				<p>
					No-shows and late cancellations are truly my least favorite situations to encounter in the online teaching business, but it's a necessity in order for me to be able to keep teaching as a reliable and sustainable occupation, which is fundamentally what allows me to be able to provide teaching opportunities in the first place. üòä Let's please work together to try to avoid late cancellation situations in the first place and we all will remain happy.
