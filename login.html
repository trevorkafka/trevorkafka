					Accounts are automatically created after registering for a <a href="call.html">free introductory call</a>. If you are having trouble logging in and you haven't taken class with me in over a year, your account may have been archived.

				<h2>Summer 2025 Update</h2>
				<p>
					Starting Summer 2025, Iâ€™ve updated my booking system on TutorBird. 
						<ul>
							<li> Instead of fixed 60-minute slots, <strong>you can now book lessons on the half hour whenever Iâ€™m available.</strong> Timing conflicts with other students are avoided automatically by the system.
							<li> <strong>You can also change your default lesson length to whatever works best for you</strong> â€” not just 60 minutes. <strong>Send me an email</strong> at <trevorkafka-email></trevorkafka-email> to update your default lesson length.
						</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					As a part of this change, to schedule lessons, login and click <strong>"Find and Book"</strong> at the top of the calendar to view available dates and times. Click on any day on the calendar with availability to schedule your lesson.

					<ul>
						<li>The online registration system will not accept cancellations once the 24 hour window has passed.</li>
						<li>Late-cancelled lessons (cancellations less than 24 hours in advance) are still billable.</li>
						<li>Registrations can be made for classes up to 12 hours before a class start time. Please note that registrations made within 12-24 hours before a class start time cannot be cancelled online. If you make a registration in error when registering less than 24 hours in advance, email me immediately at

							</span>
						or text me to confirm availability. I cannot guarantee that my listed availability online is accurate with less than 12 hours notice, but I can make work what is possible.</li>
						<li>Email reminders for appointments are automatically sent 36 hours in advance and SMS reminders (when opted-in) are sent 2 hours in advance. </li>
						<li>Please make sure your contact information on your account is up-to-date and that notifications are on if you would like to receive reminders.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						No-shows and late cancellations are truly my least favorite situations to encounter in the online teaching business, but it's a necessity in order for me to be able to keep teaching as a reliable and sustainable occupation, which is fundamentally what allows me to be able to provide teaching opportunities in the first place. ðŸ˜Š Let's please work together to try to avoid late cancellation situations in the first place and we all will remain happy.

				<summary>How can I hide empty lesson time slots or show full time slots on the calendar?</summary>
				<br>
				<p>
					By default, the calendar will show available lesson time slots and hide lesson time slots that have been filled. At times however, it may be useful to hide empty lesson time slots if you want an easier picture of the classes that you have already reserved. At other times, it may be helpful to show full lesson time slots so that you can have a better understanding of how my general schedule works, even if that means seeing lesson time slots that have already been reserved by others. 
				</p>
				<p>
					If you would like to hide empty lesson time slots or show full time slots on the calendar, consult the following steps.
					<ol>
						<li>Navigate to <em>Calendar</em> from the main menu on the left.</li>
						<li>Click <em>Search</em> in the toolbar.</li>
						<li>Check or uncheck <em>Show full events</em> or <em>Show open lesson timeslots</em> based on your personal preferences.</li>
