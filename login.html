					<li>The online registration system will not accept cancellations once the 24 hour window has passed.</li>
					<li>Late-cancelled lessons (cancellations less than 24 hours in advance) are still billable.</li>
					<li>Registrations can be made for classes up to 12 hours before a class start time. Please note that registrations made within 12-24 hours before a class start time cannot be cancelled online. If you make a registration in error when registering less than 24 hours in advance, email me immediately at

							<a onclick="copyEmail()" onmouseout="outFunc()">tutor@trevorkafka.com</a>
							<span class="tooltiptext">Copy to clipboard</span>
						</span>
					or text me to confirm availability. I cannot guarantee that my listed availability online is accurate with less than 12 hours notice, but I can make work what is possible.</li>
					<li>Email reminders for appointments are automatically sent 36 hours in advance and SMS reminders (when opted-in) are sent 2 hours in advance. </li>
					<li>Please make sure your contact information on your account is up-to-date and that notifications are on if you would like to receive reminders.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					No-shows and late cancellations are truly my least favorite situations to encounter in the online teaching business, but it's a necessity in order for me to be able to keep teaching as a reliable and sustainable occupation, which is fundamentally what allows me to be able to provide teaching opportunities in the first place. ðŸ˜Š Let's please work together to try to avoid late cancellation situations in the first place and we all will remain happy.
